# Star wars API <br/>

[LIVE](https://all-rest-countriess.netlify.app/) <br/>

Built with react js and [Star Wars Api](https://swapi.dev/documentation) <br/>

### Some helper libraries I used
- React Bootstrap
- React Reveal
- [Depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck) to scan for unused dependencies

### Documentation
- Login with a valid email and password must be alphanumeric.
- On successful login, users should see the overview login.
- Users can click on any item to see more details about that item .
- Session storage is used to keep login session until user exits the session.
